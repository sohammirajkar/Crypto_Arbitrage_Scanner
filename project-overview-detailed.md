## üíª Implementation Highlights

### C++ Version (Ultra Low-Latency)

- **Memory-aligned data structures** for cache efficiency
- **Lock-free queues** using atomic operations and memory ordering
- **Custom memory pools** for zero-allocation message handling  
- **SIMD optimizations** for mathematical computations
- **Thread pinning** to specific CPU cores with sched_setaffinity

#### Advanced Multithreading Implementation

The C++ implementation uses a sophisticated threading model:

1. **Exchange-specific Reader Threads**: Each exchange connection is managed by a dedicated thread that handles WebSocket communication and initial message parsing. This design isolates I/O operations and prevents slow connections from blocking other exchanges.

2. **Processor Thread Pool**: A configurable pool of worker threads performs the computationally intensive anomaly detection algorithms. Work is distributed using lock-free queues (moodycamel::ReaderWriterQueue) to ensure optimal load balancing without mutex overhead.

3. **NUMA-aware Thread Placement**: Threads are pinned to specific CPU cores with consideration for NUMA topology. Memory allocation is done from the local NUMA node to minimize cross-node memory access latency.

4. **Zero-copy Message Passing**: Market data flows between threads using lock-free queues with atomic operations, eliminating copy overhead and reducing synchronization overhead.

#### Low-latency Optimization Techniques

1. **Custom Memory Allocators**: Implements slab allocators for small, frequently allocated objects and memory pools for larger structures. This eliminates allocation overhead and prevents memory fragmentation. Uses template-based MemoryPool<T> for zero-allocation message handling.

2. **Branch Prediction Optimization**: Conditional logic in hot paths is structured to be predictable by the CPU's branch predictor. Frequently executed branches are made predictable through careful ordering and design.

3. **Cache-conscious Data Structures**: Data structures are designed with cache locality in mind. Frequently accessed fields are packed together and aligned to cache line boundaries to minimize cache misses. MarketTick structure is optimized to 64 bytes for efficient cache line usage.

4. **Busy-waiting with Exponential Backoff**: In critical sections where waiting is necessary, the implementation uses busy-waiting with exponential backoff to avoid context switching overhead while preventing excessive CPU consumption.

#### Core Algorithms and Data Structures

1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Used for detecting negative cycles in the price graph, which correspond to arbitrage opportunities. The implementation includes early termination optimizations and efficient cycle extraction.

2. **Logarithmic Price Graph**: Prices are stored as negative logarithms to convert multiplication operations to addition, making the Bellman-Ford algorithm more efficient.

3. **Lock-free Queues**: Uses the moodycamel::ReaderWriterQueue library for efficient inter-thread communication with single producer, single consumer optimization.

4. **Atomic Statistics**: Performance metrics are updated using atomic operations to avoid mutex contention while maintaining thread safety.

### Rust Version (Memory Safety + Performance)

- **Zero-cost abstractions** maintaining C++ performance
- **Fearless concurrency** with compile-time race condition prevention
- **Async/await patterns** for efficient I/O multiplexing
- **Memory safety guarantees** without garbage collection overhead
- **Crossbeam lock-free collections** for inter-thread communication

#### Concurrency Safety Features

The Rust implementation leverages the language's ownership system for safe concurrency:

1. **Compile-time Race Condition Prevention**: Rust's ownership model prevents data races at compile time, ensuring thread safety without runtime overhead.

2. **Lock-free Channels**: Uses crossbeam's lock-free channels for efficient message passing between threads, with bounded channels to prevent unbounded memory growth.

3. **Scoped Threads**: Employs scoped threads for parallel processing with guaranteed cleanup, preventing resource leaks.

4. **Atomic Reference Counting**: Uses Arc<AtomicT> for shared state that requires atomic updates without mutex overhead.

### Node.js Version (Rapid Development + Real-time Data)

- **WebSocket client** for real-time equity market data fetching
- **Event-driven architecture** for efficient data processing
- **REST API endpoints** for web dashboard integration
- **Real-time anomaly calculations** based on live market data
- **Easy deployment** with minimal dependencies

#### Event-driven Architecture

The Node.js implementation takes advantage of JavaScript's non-blocking I/O model:

1. **Single-threaded Event Loop**: Uses Node.js's event loop for efficient I/O multiplexing, allowing a single thread to handle multiple WebSocket connections.

2. **Worker Threads for CPU-intensive Tasks**: Offloads computationally intensive anomaly detection to worker threads using Node.js's worker_threads module, preventing blocking of the main event loop.

3. **Stream Processing**: Implements stream-based processing for continuous data flow, with backpressure handling to prevent memory overflow.

4. **Promise-based Asynchronous Operations**: Uses modern async/await patterns for clean, readable asynchronous code without callback complexity.

    for (size_t j = i + 1; j < N; ++j) {
        if (is_cointegrated(asset[i], asset[j])) {
            double spread = calculate_spread(asset[i], asset[j]);
            double z_score = calculate_z_score(spread);
            if (abs(z_score) > Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD) {
                // Anomaly detected
                generate_alert(asset[i], asset[j], z_score);
