## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Multi-threaded Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated multi-threaded design that maximizes concurrency while minimizing resource contention:

1. **Exchange-specific Worker Threads**: Each market data feed (NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE) is handled by a dedicated thread that manages the WebSocket connection and processes incoming price updates. This design ensures that a slow connection to one exchange doesn't impact the processing of data from other exchanges.

2. **Lock-free Processing Pipeline**: Price updates are passed between threads using lock-free queues (moodycamel::ReaderWriterQueue), eliminating the overhead of mutex acquisition and reducing latency. The implementation uses atomic operations for zero-copy data transfer.

3. **Processor Thread Pool**: A pool of worker threads performs the actual anomaly detection calculations. These threads pull data from the lock-free queues and execute the statistical arbitrage algorithms. The thread count can be tuned based on the available CPU cores.

4. **Asynchronous I/O Multiplexing**: The system uses epoll (Linux) or IOCP (Windows) for efficient event handling, allowing a single thread to manage multiple WebSocket connections without blocking.

### Low-latency Design Principles

The implementation follows several key principles to achieve sub-millisecond processing times:

1. **Zero-copy Data Flow**: Market data moves through the system without unnecessary copying. Price updates are written directly to lock-free queues and accessed by processor threads without intermediate allocations.

2. **Memory Pool Allocation**: All dynamic memory allocation uses custom memory pools that are pre-allocated at startup. This eliminates allocation overhead and prevents memory fragmentation that can cause unpredictable latency spikes.

3. **CPU Cache Optimization**: Data structures are designed with cache locality in mind. Frequently accessed fields are packed together, and arrays are aligned to cache line boundaries to minimize cache misses.

4. **Branch Prediction Optimization**: Conditional logic in hot paths is structured to be predictable by the CPU's branch predictor, reducing pipeline stalls.

5. **NUMA-aware Thread Placement**: Threads are pinned to specific CPU cores, and memory is allocated from the NUMA node closest to the executing thread to minimize memory access latency.

### Real-time Data Processing Pipeline

```
Market Data Feed → Network Layer → Exchange Thread → Lock-free Queue → 
Processor Thread Pool → Anomaly Detection Engine → Alert System → Web Dashboard
```

1. **Network Layer**: Uses native asynchronous socket operations for minimal overhead
2. **Message Parsing**: Implements zero-copy JSON parsing with schema validation
3. **Price Normalization**: Standardizes prices across different exchanges using pre-computed conversion factors
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Applies statistical models (cointegration, mean reversion) to detect market inefficiencies
5. **Alert Generation**: Creates notifications with detailed metadata for profitable opportunities
6. **Dashboard Updates**: Pushes real-time updates to the web interface via WebSocket

### Performance Optimization Techniques

1. **Custom Memory Allocators**: Implements slab allocators for frequently allocated objects
2. **SIMD Instructions**: Uses vectorized operations for mathematical computations in anomaly detection
3. **Kernel Bypass Patterns**: Designed for integration with DPDK for true kernel bypass networking
4. **Predictable Latency**: Employs techniques like busy-waiting with timeouts to avoid context switching overhead

### Implementation Details

#### Core Data Structures

1. **MarketTick**: A cache-efficient structure (64 bytes) that holds all relevant market data for a single price update:
   - Exchange identifier (8 bits)
   - Symbol name (16-character fixed array)
   - Bid/ask prices and volume (8 bytes each)
   - High-resolution timestamp
   - Sequence number for ordering

2. **ArbitrageOpportunity**: Represents a detected market inefficiency with:
   - Path description (e.g., "SPY -> QQQ -> DIA")
   - Profit percentage and maximum volume
   - Confidence score (0-100)
   - Detection timestamp

3. **Price Graph**: A 2D array implementing a currency graph for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, with logarithmic prices to convert multiplication to addition.

#### Algorithm Implementation

1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Used to detect negative cycles in the price graph, which correspond to arbitrage opportunities. The implementation includes:
   - Early termination when no updates occur
   - Cycle extraction for detailed opportunity reporting
   - Confidence scoring based on profit magnitude and path length

2. **Lock-free Queues**: Uses the moodycamel::ReaderWriterQueue library for efficient inter-thread communication with:
   - Single producer, single consumer optimization
   - Memory pre-allocation to avoid runtime allocations
   - Backpressure handling to prevent queue overflow

3. **Memory Management**: Implements custom memory pools for:
   - MarketTick objects (frequently allocated/deallocated)
   - ArbitrageOpportunity structures
   - Temporary calculation buffers

#### Concurrency Patterns

1. **Atomic Operations**: Used extensively for counters and flags to avoid mutex overhead
2. **Thread-local Storage**: Employs thread-local variables for per-thread state to avoid synchronization overhead
3. **Lock-free Data Structures**: All inter-thread communication uses lock-free queues
4. **Busy-waiting with Exponential Backoff**: In critical sections where waiting is necessary
