```cpp
// C++ Example
ExchangeConnector nyse("nyse", "wss://nyse.market-data.stream/ticker");
nyse.subscribe("SPY@ticker");
nyse.on_message([&](const json& msg) {
    auto price = msg["c"].get<double>();
    anomaly_engine.update_price("NYSE", "SPY", price);
});
```

```rust
// Rust Example
let mut connector = NYSEConnector::new().await?;
connector.subscribe("SPY@ticker").await?;

while let Some(msg) = connector.recv().await {
    let price: f64 = msg["c"].as_str().unwrap().parse()?;
    anomaly_engine.update_price("NYSE", "SPY", price).await;
}
```

## 📊 Real-world Data Sources

All market data comes from official exchange APIs:

- **NYSE API**: Real-time ticker and orderbook data
- **NASDAQ API**: Live price feeds via WebSocket
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Historical price data for backtesting

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### Multi-threaded Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated multi-threaded design that maximizes concurrency while minimizing resource contention:

1. **Exchange-specific Worker Threads**: Each market data feed (NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE) is handled by a dedicated thread that manages the WebSocket connection and processes incoming price updates. This design ensures that a slow connection to one exchange doesn't impact the processing of data from other exchanges.

2. **Lock-free Processing Pipeline**: Price updates are passed between threads using lock-free ring buffers, eliminating the overhead of mutex acquisition and reducing latency. The implementation uses memory-mapped ring buffers with atomic read/write indices for zero-copy data transfer.

3. **Processor Thread Pool**: A pool of worker threads performs the actual anomaly detection calculations. These threads pull data from the ring buffers and execute the statistical arbitrage algorithms. The thread count can be tuned based on the available CPU cores.

4. **Asynchronous I/O Multiplexing**: The system uses epoll (Linux) or IOCP (Windows) for efficient event handling, allowing a single thread to manage multiple WebSocket connections without blocking.

### Low-latency Design Principles

The implementation follows several key principles to achieve sub-millisecond processing times:

1. **Zero-copy Data Flow**: Market data moves through the system without unnecessary copying. Price updates are written directly to ring buffers and accessed by processor threads without intermediate allocations.

2. **Memory Pool Allocation**: All dynamic memory allocation uses custom memory pools that are pre-allocated at startup. This eliminates allocation overhead and prevents memory fragmentation that can cause unpredictable latency spikes.

3. **CPU Cache Optimization**: Data structures are designed with cache locality in mind. Frequently accessed fields are packed together, and arrays are aligned to cache line boundaries to minimize cache misses.

4. **Branch Prediction Optimization**: Conditional logic in hot paths is structured to be predictable by the CPU's branch predictor, reducing pipeline stalls.

5. **NUMA-aware Thread Placement**: Threads are pinned to specific CPU cores, and memory is allocated from the NUMA node closest to the executing thread to minimize memory access latency.

### Real-time Data Processing Pipeline

```
Market Data Feed → Network Layer → Exchange Thread → Lock-free Ring Buffer → 
Processor Thread Pool → Anomaly Detection Engine → Alert System → Web Dashboard
```

1. **Network Layer**: Uses native asynchronous socket operations for minimal overhead
2. **Message Parsing**: Implements zero-copy JSON parsing with schema validation
3. **Price Normalization**: Standardizes prices across different exchanges using pre-computed conversion factors
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Applies statistical models (cointegration, mean reversion) to detect market inefficiencies
5. **Alert Generation**: Creates notifications with detailed metadata for profitable opportunities
6. **Dashboard Updates**: Pushes real-time updates to the web interface via WebSocket

### Performance Optimization Techniques

1. **Custom Memory Allocators**: Implements slab allocators for frequently allocated objects
2. **SIMD Instructions**: Uses vectorized operations for mathematical computations in anomaly detection
3. **Kernel Bypass Patterns**: Designed for integration with DPDK for true kernel bypass networking
4. **Predictable Latency**: Employs techniques like busy-waiting with timeouts to avoid context switching overhead

### Concurrency Patterns

1. **Reader-Writer Locks**: Used for shared data structures that are frequently read but infrequently updated
2. **Lock-free Stacks**: Implemented for temporary object storage to avoid allocation overhead
3. **Atomic Operations**: Used for counters and flags to avoid mutex contention
4. **Thread-local Storage**: Employs thread-local variables for per-thread state to avoid synchronization overhead

### Implementation-Specific Details

#### C++ Implementation

1. **Lock-free Queues**: Uses the moodycamel::ReaderWriterQueue library for efficient inter-thread communication with single producer, single consumer optimization
2. **Memory Pools**: Implements template-based MemoryPool<T> for zero-allocation message handling of frequently used objects
3. **Cache-efficient Structures**: MarketTick structure is optimized to 64 bytes for efficient cache line usage
4. **Atomic Statistics**: Performance metrics updated using atomic operations to avoid mutex contention

#### Rust Implementation

1. **Crossbeam Channels**: Uses lock-free channels for efficient message passing between threads
2. **Arc<AtomicT>**: Atomic reference counting for shared state that requires atomic updates
3. **Scoped Threads**: Guarantees cleanup and prevents resource leaks
4. **Compile-time Safety**: Ownership model prevents data races at compile time

#### Node.js Implementation

1. **Event Loop**: Single-threaded event loop for efficient I/O multiplexing
2. **Worker Threads**: CPU-intensive tasks offloaded to worker threads to prevent blocking
3. **Stream Processing**: Continuous data flow with backpressure handling
4. **Promise-based Operations**: Clean asynchronous code without callback complexity
